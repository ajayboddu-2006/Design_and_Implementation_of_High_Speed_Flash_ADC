# Design and Implementation of High Speed Flash ADC

This repository contains the design, simulation, and implementation files for a **High-Speed Flash Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)**, developed using **eSIM** as part of the **FOSSEE Research Migration Project**.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the design of a high-speed Flash ADC using both **analog** and **digital** components. The analog front-end consists of a resistor ladder and comparator array, while the digital backend includes a **priority encoder** implemented in **Verilog HDL**. The complete system was simulated using **co-simulation in eSIM**, leveraging Ngspice for analog behavior and Makerchip for digital logic.

## Tools & Technologies

- [eSIM](https://esim.fossee.in/) â€“ Open-source EDA tool by FOSSEE, IIT Bombay

## Objectives

- Design a fully functional high-speed Flash ADC using open-source tools.
- Demonstrate integration of analog and digital blocks via co-simulation.
- Contribute to the **FOSSEE Research Migration Project**, encouraging the use of eSIM in VLSI design education and development.

## Recognition

Selected for the **FOSSEE Summer Fellowship 2025 at IIT Bombay** based on this project, to further contribute to open-source EDA development and migration efforts.
